# Barebones Metalsmith
## A boilerplate for creating websites with Metalsmtih
I've created this repository to eliminate the task of reinstalling my core plugins and rewriting my core `build.js` file every time I start a Metalsmith website.

## Included in this boilerplate
In order of inclusion inside `build.js`.

## How to use this boilerplate
In order of importance/implementation.

#### Layouts
Currently, the boilerplate uses Handlebars templates for layouts. Edit the `layouts/index.hbs` file to modify the index template, which is applied to the `src/index.md` file. 

To create a new layout, simply add a new file with the appropriate name to `layouts/` with the suffix of `.hbs`. To apply this layout to a template, add `layout: <layout>.hbs` to any and all (each layout can be applied to more than one) `.md` file in `src/` that you want it to be applied to.


#### Assets 
To add static assets to your `build/` directory, add them to the `assets/` folder in the structure you want them in. They are currently piped to `assets/` in the `build/` directory when the build script is run, but this can be changed in the `build.js` file's `.use(assets())` call with the `destination` property.

#### Markdown source files
All Markdown source files should go into `src/`. They can be iterated, modified, and pulled from the `metalsmith-layouts` plugin, with the assistance of `metalsmith-collections` metadata and Handlebar's helper functions like `{{#each}}` and `{{#if}}`. Metadata can be pulled from inside the front-matter in these helper functions where the collection has been explicitly stated by simply calling the metadata's name; i.e. `{{title}}` to return `Title Here` from the `title: Title Here` metadata INSIDE the front-matter. 

Here is a template for basic front-matter that can be extended:

```
---
title:
slug:
layout:
collection:
---
```

#### Collections
Collections have deliberately been left empty, so as not to force any certain pattern or become reliant on defaults. Look at the `metalsmith-collections` documentation to see how to implement them.
